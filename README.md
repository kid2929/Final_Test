# Degen Token (DGN)

## Overview
Degen Token is a Solidity smart contract that implements a basic ERC20 token, "Degen" (symbol: DGN), designed for in-game usage. It provides functionalities for creating, managing, and utilizing tokens within a gaming ecosystem.

## Features
- **Minting New Tokens**: The contract allows the owner to create and distribute new tokens as rewards.
- **Transferring Tokens**: Players can transfer tokens to other addresses within the platform.
- **Redeeming Tokens**: Players can exchange tokens for in-game items available in the store.
- **Checking Token Balance**: Players can easily check their token balance at any time.
- **Burning Tokens**: Users can permanently destroy tokens they no longer need.

## Usage
- **Minting**: Only the contract owner can mint new tokens using the `mint` function.
- **Transferring**: Players can transfer tokens to others using the standard ERC20 `transfer` function.
- **Redeeming**: Tokens can be redeemed for in-game items by calling the `redeem` function.
- **Burning**: Tokens can be permanently removed from circulation by burning them with the `burn` function.
- **Checking Balance**: Players can check their token balance by calling the `getBalance` function.
- **Managing Store Items**: The owner can add and remove items from the in-game store using the provided functions.

## Implementation Details
- **ERC20 Compliance**: Built on OpenZeppelin's ERC20 standard, ensuring compatibility with existing tools and platforms.
- **Owner Control**: The contract includes access control through the Ownable contract, restricting certain functions to the owner.
- **Event Emission**: Events are emitted for token redemptions, burns, and store item management, enabling easy tracking of transactions.
- **Efficient String Conversion**: Utility functions are provided to convert uint to string for displaying store item details efficiently.

## Getting Started
To deploy and interact with the Degen Token contract, you'll need a Solidity development environment and knowledge of Ethereum smart contracts.
